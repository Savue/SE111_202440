        <p style="border:1px solid yellow;">Hello! A few things about me that I believe are noteworthy is I am orginally from/born in Michigan, I grew up in what is called Metro Detroit most of my life until I joined the Air Force, after joining and getting out I have lived in many places including Las Vegas, Nevada. San Antonio,Texas. Spokane, Washington. Vacaville, California. As I said Michigan and now Newport, Rhode Island which is where I currently reside.
        I have gotten asked before to list off or just even choose my favorite place I've lived but honestly It's hard to choose a favorite place I have lived at. Each of the states are vastly different and offered so many unique things that the others did not, I feel it would be unfair to even try to put one at the top and one at the bottom, they all have their ups and downs.

        <b>BUT</b> I can list my favorite borg places so I shall do that instead to prove I am competent enough to order 5 things</p>
