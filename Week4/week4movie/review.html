            <h2>REVIEW OF <em>Bulder's Gate 3</em></h2>

            <p><b>Joseph Longroy, </b><i> August 8th, 2024</i></p>

            <p>Baldur's Gate 3 is a popular game developed by Larian Studios and reciever of the 2023 Game of the Year - Larian are also the creators of other popular franchises such as Divinity Original Sin - Baldur's Gate 3 at its core is a turned-based strategy game set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons, where you will have to make tough choices that all have their consequences, meet interesting characters, possibly even find romance all as you fight ruthless enemies in unknown lands. I found myself getting lost in the beautiful environments, where it felt every little detail had a purpose, constantly meeting new characters who all moved and acted like actual <i>real</i> people, not just AI NPCs, it is truly a breath of fresh air from the sea of video games where their inhabitants act like boring robots forced to read a script with a stale face. The combat is perfect strategy sandbox where you <i>truly</i> are free - see that barrel of oil? Set it on fire and blow everyone up, see something on the roof hanging down? Shoot it and make it land on your enemies, see a massive pit that leads into complete darkness? Push the boss into the pit for an instant end to a hard fight (but say goodbye to their loot since you can't get to their body!). It seems Larian truly thought of everything when it comes to gameplay and it makes it a dream to play; a true game where you can get lost in another universe. In the end, any fan of Dungeons & Dragons, whether its playing the table top game with your friends or binge watching DnD content online or TV shows like Vox Machina (if you, veiwer, have not watched - add that to your list of newfound obsessions along with BG3) you should without a doubt give this game a go, I beleive it is worth anyone and everyone's time.</p>
